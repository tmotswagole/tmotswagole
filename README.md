 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Thabiso's Experience</h3></summary>

	Software Application and Information Solutions (SAiS)
	Gaborone, Botswana
	Full Stack Developer
	Dec 2020 ‚Äî Aug 2021

	- Acted as the sole developer on a module that would allow customers to log tickets on incidents, questions, or compliments, allowing an admin on the Botswana Life system to reach out and chat with them all on the website. Developed the website using React and Spring Boot. This significantly reduced the customer care unit load, freeing up time for more unique issues.
	- Slashed image load times, reducing it by compressing and lazy loading images. This drastically improved load times by up to 40%.
	- Refined a manual process by creating MySQL events to handle multiple actions upon "insert" when registering a new user, allowing the system to set a timer that would change values if the customer failed to verify their account. This removed lag times of having to manually perform the operation from the IT side removing dependency on IT to registered users.
	- Redesigned the entire frontend of Botswana Life's customer portal. Updated it to take advantage of F-shape reading research, which increased website customer retention by 10%. After the deployment of changes, educated trainees using presentations and code examples to guide them through the design thought process and other frontend design standards.
	- Perfected Hollard's API, adding features that would convert user-provided data files to then automatically post to various banks. This automated a previously time-consuming and manual task that took hours.

	African Banking Cooperation (BancABC)
	Gaborone, Botswana
	ATM & Cards Support Officer
	May 2020 ‚Äî Dec 2020

	- Designed a database query to allow users to directly pull reports on ATM transactions by date. It was installed on a server and enabled users to download the data from the web page. This would extract transactional data from the database and distribute it via BI Publisher. This helped to mitigate any issues caused by IT staff running the report continuously in order to automate it for bank users also allowing the searching of older data.
	- Mitigated the reconciliation risk of missing ATM activity upon application crashes by developing a Python app to search ATM log files and return eJournal logs (the ATM activity during transactions and daily service) in a readable txt format. The old method was not always accurate, resulting in corrupted or missing eJournal entries.
	- Deployed 4 deposit taking NCR ATMs to production and configured them onto the BankWorld system. This enabled the bank's service centres (which serve a small to medium population base) to accept deposits and cash withdrawals where they previously could not. As a result, all branches do not need to take in customers for deposit scenarios reducing bank teller congestion.
	- Was part of a team that increased the bank's PCI compliance from 30% to nearly 70%. The goal of this project was to adhere to the PCI-DSS protocols and convert systems to be compliant. This project assisted in mitigating major risks such as hacking and policy failures.

	African Banking Cooperation (BancABC)
	Gaborone, Botswana
	Information Technology Officer
	Nov 2019 ‚Äî May 2020

	- Maximized work efficiency by developing a Python executable file that generates weekly and monthly reports in Microsoft Excel with graphs. This eliminated almost two hours spent from the old manual system for creating weekly reports and two weeks from the monthly reports. This sped up the process, allowing it to be completed in 10 minutes with minor alterations to colours.
	- Configured Microsoft Azure and Oracle Management Cloud to allow IT to monitor, alert and track web apps and servers. This helped to reduce response times to the majority of critical severity incidents, to 10 min rather than the previous unmonitored which would at times take an hour or 2.

	Botswana Unified Revenue Services (BURS)
	Gaborone, Botswana
	Intern Fullstack Developer
	Jan 2018 ‚Äî Jun 2018

	- Developed BURS' first Android application with Android Studio (Java with Retrofit) and Spring Boot frameworks. This application allowed users to file tax returns and pay off any outstanding tax debts. This project significantly reduced website traffic by funnelling individual users to the application while the companies used the website, resulting in fewer server holdups and crashes per month (due to traffic) from 5 or 4 to 1.
	- The mobile app has over 5000 installs, with all positive user feedback and few to no crashes.
